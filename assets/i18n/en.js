  ourMissionSummary: 'Empowering building a secure and trustworthy web3 world.',
  ourMissionDetail: 'Based on the concept of continuous security threat and risk assessment (CARTA), it focuses on providing data-driven security, trust measurement service, and security consulting for web3 projects, namely Trustworthy as a Service (TaaS). We provide continuous and accurate security threat and risk assessment mechanisms in different building level and use scenarios (e.g.,Smart contract, NFT, Protocol, Infrastructure of web3 systems and projects) . We believe that a trustworthy understanding of project semantic (code logic), data flows (e.g., token txn) and the tokenomic incentive models are the key to help build a true valuable world of stable and secure web3 systems.',
